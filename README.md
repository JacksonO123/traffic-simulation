# Traffic Simulation

The goal of this project is to try to accurately simulate the behavior of traffic on highways and roadways

## Currently working on: **Decision making**

Cars should change lanes if they are behind a slow car, or stopped in traffic

## Todo

- [x] Acceleration
- [x] Lane changing
- [ ] Add speed limits for roads
- [ ] Decision making
  - Cars should know when to change lanes

## Technical details
