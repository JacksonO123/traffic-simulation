# Traffic Simulation

The goal of this project is to try to accurately simulate the behavior of traffic on highways and roadways

## Currently working on: **Intersections**

Cars should change lanes if they are behind a slow car, or stopped in traffic

## Todo

- [ ] Add various types of intersections
- [ ] Add intersections as a part of a cars route
- [x] Acceleration
- [x] Lane changing
- [x] Add speed limits for roads
- [x] Decision making
  - Cars should know when to change lanes
