# Traffic Simulation

The goal of this project is to try to accurately simulate the behavior of traffic on highways and roadways

## Currently working on: **Breaking**

Currently breaking is dependent on the distance to the car in front of you.

In the future the amount of speed deducted will depend on a breaking amount parameter that is derived from a distance function to the nearest car in front.

## Todo

- [ ] Acceleration
- [ ] Lane changing
